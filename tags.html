			<p><i>I'm just your average white-washed Armenian Seattlelite trying to figure out what the heck I'm doing with my life.I might be a lawyer, but I'm not sure yet. My mom really wants me to be, just because she equivicates that with success, but I'm not sure I would want to be a criminal defense lawyer after seeing how my dad has handled his business. I'll probably end up working for a non-profit, but ultimately I'm basic and just want to travel the world.</i></p>
			<p><i>I like the idea of traveling to Armenia (the motherland) because I feel like I should really visit my roots in order to understand how I came to be. That's why I'm interested in doing this program called "Birthright Armenia" where people over 20 years old can spend a few weeks there to contribute to society and also see where their ancestors originated after the Armenian Genocide.</i></p>
